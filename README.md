# smart_traffic_management_system
 The current traffic management system in most of the Indian cities are either based on the fixed timer control mode or the manual
 control traffic management. As technology becomes mature  Machine Learning is one of the emerging application of Artificial Intelligence
 nowadays and its infrastructure is also increasing, it can be helpful for solving many traffic problems, in this paper we propose 
 Reinforcement Learning approach with the help of Convolution-Neural-Network to minimize the average waiting time of vehicles at an 
 intersection.
 
Software Tools Used :

SUMO/Python IDE

Virtual Machine Environment on Anaconda ,we needed to install tensorflow to support keras API.

Matplotlib, logfile.txt,Hp5 file to store data in binary form.

To Run this code:
step 1: Activate your virtual environment 
.venv\scripts\activate

step 2:
open cmd and Change the current working directory to your local project
for example : cd desktop

step 3:RUN your .py file
C:\Users\PROJECT\Desktop>python traffic_light_control2.py
